This project presents a comprehensive analysis of cancer surgery dynamics, focusing on the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS coding systems. Spanning the years 2013 to 2021, the research explores surgery volumes, geographical variations, and predictive modeling using a dataset obtained from the Data.gov catalog. Employing Python, R, and SQL, the analysis reveals noteworthy trends in surgery volumes post-coding transition, identifies top-performing counties and hospitals, and introduces a Poisson regression model for predictions. The findings contribute valuable insights into the evolving landscape of cancer surgeries, aiding healthcare planning and resource allocation.
